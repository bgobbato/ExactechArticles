Abstract
Background: Extensive proximal humeral bone loss in the setting of shoulder arthroplasty represents a difficult challenge for the treating surgeon. Achieving adequate fixation with standard humeral prostheses can be problematic. Allograft-prosthetic composites are a viable solution for this problem, however high rates of complications have been reported. Modular proximal humeral replacement systems are another potential solution, but there is a paucity of outcome data on these implants. This study reports the two-year minimum follow-up outcomes and complications of a single system reverse proximal humeral reconstruction prosthesis (RHRP) for patients with extensive proximal humeral bone loss.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all patients with minimum two-year follow-up who underwent implantation of a RHRP for either 1) failed shoulder arthroplasty or 2) proximal humerus fracture with severe bone loss (Pharos 2 and 3) and/or sequelae thereof. Forty-four patients met inclusion criteria (average age 68.3 ± 13.1 years). The average follow-up was 36.2 ± 12.4 months. Demographic information, operative data, and complications were recorded. Pre- and postoperative range of motion (ROM), pain, and outcome scores were assessed and compared to the MCID and SCB for primary rTSA where available.

Results: Of the 44 RHRPs evaluated, 93% (n=39) had undergone prior surgery and 70% (n=30) were performed for failed arthroplasty. ROM improved significantly in abduction by 22° (P = .006) and forward elevation by 28° (P = .003). Average pain on a daily basis and pain at worst improved significantly, by 2.0 points (P < .001) and 2.7 points (P < .001), respectively. Mean SST score improved by 3.2 (P < .001), Constant score by 10.9 (P = .030), ASES score by 29.7 (P < .001), UCLA score by 10.6 (P < .001), and SPADI score by 37.4 (P < .001). A majority of patients achieved the MCID for all outcome measures assessed (56-81%). The SCB was exceeded by half of patients for forward elevation and the Constant score (50%), and exceeded by the majority of patients for the ASES score (58%) and UCLA score (58%). The complication rate was 28%; the most common complication was dislocation requiring closed reduction. Notably, there were no occurrences of humeral loosening requiring revision surgery.

Discussion: This data demonstrates that the RHRP resulted in significant improvements in ROM, pain, and PROMs, without the risk of early humeral component loosening. RHRP represents another potential solution for shoulder arthroplasty surgeons when addressing extensive proximal humerus bone loss.

Abstract
Introduction: Early reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) designs had high failure rates, mainly from loosening of the glenoid baseplate. The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening after primary rTSA using a contemporary medialized glenoid/lateralized humeral system and identify significant risk factors associated with loosening.

Methods: 7,162 primary rTSA were treated with a single platform rTSA system between April 2007 and August 2021, from which 3,127 primary rTSA patients with a minimum 2-year follow-up were identified. Patients with aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening were compared to all other primary rTSA without loosening. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to compare these cohorts and identify the demographic, comorbidities, operative, and implants associated aseptic glenoid loosening after rTSA. Odds ratios were calculated for each significant risk factor and for multiple combinations of risk factors.

Results: Irrespective of minimum follow-up, fifty-three (31F/22M) of 7,162 primary rTSA shoulders experienced aseptic glenoid loosening, for an overall rate of 0.74%. At latest 2-year minimum follow-up, thirty of 3,127 patients experienced aseptic glenoid loosening and had significantly lower clinical scores, function, active ROM, and higher pain scores as compared to patients without loosening. Univariate analysis identified that patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA, p=0.029, OR = 2.74) and diabetes (p=0.028, OR=1.84) and multivariate analysis identified Walch glenoid types B2 (p=0.002, OR= 4.513) and B3 (p=0.002, OR=14.804), use of expanded lateralized glenospheres (p=0.025, OR=2.57) and use of augmented baseplates (p=0.001, OR=2.50) as significant risk factors for aseptic glenoid loosening after rTSA.

Conclusion: The incidence of aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening was 0.74% for this medialized glenoid/lateralized humeral rTSA system. Numerous risk factors for aseptic loosening were identified, including: RA, diabetes, Walch B2 and B3 glenoids, posterior/superior augmented baseplates, and expanded lateralized glenospheres. Finally, analysis of multiple combinations of risk factors identified patients and implant configurations with the greatest risk of aseptic glenoid loosening.

Abstract
Background: Identifying risk factors for acromial and scapular fractures improves our understanding about which variables are relevant to this fracture complication; however, this data is difficult to integrate into clinical practice because the majority of rTSA patients have 1 or more risk factors. The goal of this study is to better facilitate preoperative identification of patients at-risk for acromial and scapular fracture and quantify the impact of accumulating risk factors on the incidence of fracture.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 9,079 rTSA patients from a multi-center database of a single medialized glenoid/lateralized humerus onlay rTSA prosthesis to quantify the rate of acromial and scapular fractures. A univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors for fracture. Next, we quantified the number of patients with one or multiple significant risk factors for fracture. Finally, to facilitate preoperative identification of patients most at-risk for fracture, we stratified our dataset by multiple combinations of age, gender, and diagnosis risk factors and calculated the odds ratio for each cohort to quantify the impact of accumulating risk factors on the incidence of fracture.

Results: 138 of 9,079 patients were radiographically identified to have a fracture of the acromion or scapula for a rate of 1.52%. Patients with fractures were more likely older, female, more likely to have a RA diagnosis, CTA diagnosis, and less likely to have diabetes diagnosis. 85% of rTSA patients had at least 1 fracture risk factor. Individually, age, gender, or diagnosis failed to identify any patient cohort with an odds ratio >2.5. Use of multiple combinations of patient risk factors refined identification of at-risk patients better than any individual or 2-risk factor combination and demonstrated that the patients with the greatest fracture risk were females with RA diagnosis >70 years, >75 years, and >80 years.

Conclusion: This 9,079 rTSA multi-center study demonstrated that 1.52% of patients experienced acromial and/or scapular fractures with single medialized glenoid/lateralized humerus onlay rTSA prosthesis. Our analysis identified numerous risk factors and quantified the impact of accumulating risk factors on fracture incidence. Patients considering rTSA with these age, gender, and diagnosis risk factors should be made aware of their elevated complication risk.

Abstract
Background: The goal of this longitudinal analysis of aTSA and rTSA utilization from 2007-2021 is to quantify changes in clinical outcomes, cost, and value, resulting from the introduction and adoption of new shoulder arthroplasty technologies.

Methods: We analyzed an international database of a single shoulder arthroplasty prosthesis (Equinoxe; Exactech, Inc; Gainesville, FL, USA) for all clinical sites that have continuously enrolled cases from 2007 to 2021 to compare changes in primary aTSA and primary rTSA utilization and outcomes across three, 5-year cohorts based upon the date of implantation. A value analysis was conducted across the 5-year implantation cohorts, with value measured by the ratio of each postoperative outcome measure at 24-36 months and 36-60 months after surgery and the average implant selling price each year for the US sites in constant 2007 US dollars, these measures of value were compared between cohorts to quantify the impact of new technology introduced over the study period.

Results: A dramatic increase in rTSA utilization was observed across the 6 sites over the 15-year study period, along with a rapid adoption of new aTSA and rTSA technologies. The average patient receiving primary aTSA and primary rTSA changed over the 15-year study period, with significant shifts in diagnosis, comorbidities, and preoperative functional status. A comparison of postoperative results demonstrated that both aTSA and rTSA clinical and radiographic outcomes showed improvement relative to 2007-2011. Over this 15-year study period, the average aTSA implant selling price has been relatively stable while the average rTSA implant selling price has significantly declined. As a result, the value associated with the Equinoxe rTSA significantly increased for nearly every outcome measure at 24-36 months and 36-60 months after surgery, while value associated with the Equinoxe aTSA stayed relatively constant from 2007-2021.

Conclusion: Our 6,042-patient longitudinal analysis quantified numerous changes in utilization, outcomes, and value across 6 clinical sites over the past 15-years. Rapid adoption of new aTSA and rTSA technologies was observed and clinical and radiographic outcomes improved relative to 2007-2011. These clinical improvements, in combination with steady aTSA and declining rTSA implant prices, have driven rTSA value to continuously increase while aTSA value has been maintained at a high-level over the 15-year study period with this particular shoulder arthroplasty system, even when considering the cost and adoption of new technologies.

Abstract
Background: The Shoulder Arthroplasty Smart (SAS) score is a new, validated machine learning-derived outcome measure that requires six input parameters. The SAS score has the potential to replace legacy shoulder outcome scores.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of a multinational shoulder arthroplasty database of one platform shoulder prosthesis (used interchangeably for anatomic and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty). All primary shoulder arthroplasties with a minimum of two-year follow-up and an available SAS score were evaluated. Associations between scoring systems were assessed using Pearson correlations, with 95% confidence intervals stratified by time point (preoperatively and postoperatively at 2- and 5-year follow-ups, respectively) and procedure (anatomic verses reverse total shoulder arthroplasty). Conversion equations were developed using the best-fit line from linear regression analysis. Ceiling effects were assessed based on two definitions: (1) >15% of participants scoring the maximal possible score and (2) a standardized distance less than 1.0, whereby the standardized distance is calculated by subtracting the mean from the maximal score and dividing by the standard deviation.

Results: Two thousand four hundred six shoulders were evaluated at 4,553 clinical encounters. For preoperatively collected data, the SAS score correlated strongly with the Constant (R = 0.83), University of California at Los Angeles (R = 0.85), and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (R = -0.70) scores and moderately with the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (R = 0.69) and Simple Shoulder Test (R = 0.65) scores. The SAS score strongly correlated (R > 0.7) with all legacy outcome scores collected at 2- and 5-year postoperative visits. Score predictions made using the conversion equations between the SAS score and legacy outcome scores strongly correlated with their actual values. Neither the SAS nor the Constant score were influenced by ceiling effects. All other outcome scores evaluated demonstrated ceiling effects.

Conclusion: The SAS score correlates well with legacy shoulder scores after primary shoulder arthroplasty while mitigating ceiling effects. Surgeons may decrease patient questionnaire burden by using the brief six-question SAS score.

PMID: 36436090 DOI: 10.1007/s00590-022-03446-1
Abstract
Purpose: Software algorithms are increasingly available as clinical decision support tools (CDSTs) to support shared decision-making. We sought to understand if patient-specific predictions from a CDST would impact orthopedic surgeons' preoperative planning decisions and corresponding confidence.

Methods: We performed a survey study of orthopedic surgeons with at minimum of 2 years of independent shoulder arthroplasty experience. We generated patient profiles for 18 faux cases presenting with glenohumeral osteoarthritis and emailed 93 surgeons requesting their recommendation for anatomic or reverse total shoulder arthroplasty for each case and their certainty in their recommendation on a 4-point Likert scale. The thirty respondents were later sent a second survey with the same cases that now included predicted patient-specific outcomes and complication rates generated by a CDST.

Results: Initial recommendations and changes in recommendation varied widely by surgeon and by case. After viewing the results of the CDST, surgeons switched from anatomic to reverse recommendations in 46 instances (12% of initial anatomic) and from reverse to anatomic in 22 instances (6% of initial reverse). Overall, surgeon change in confidence increased significantly across all responses (p = 0.0001), with certain cases and certain surgeons having significant changes. Change in confidence did not correlate with surgeon-specific factors, including years in practice.

Conclusion: The addition of CDST reports to preoperative planning for anatomic and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty informed decision-making but did not direct recommendations uniformly. However, the CDST information provided did increase surgeon confidence regardless of implant selection and irrespective of surgeon experience.

Abstract
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of primary reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) using glenoid bone grafting (BG rTSA) with primary rTSA using augmented glenoid baseplates (Aug rTSA) with a minimum 2-year follow-up.

Methods: A total of 520 primary rTSA patients treated with 8° posterior glenoid augments (n = 246), 10° superior glenoid augments (n = 97), or combined 10° superior/8° posterior glenoid augments (n = 177) were compared with 47 patients undergoing glenoid bone grafting for glenoid bone insufficiency. The mean follow-up was 37.0(±16) and 53.0(±27) months, respectively. Outcomes were analyzed preoperatively and at the latest follow-up using conventional statistics and stratification by minimum clinically important difference (MCID) and substantial clinical benefit (SCB) thresholds where applicable. Radiographs were analyzed for baseplate failure, and the incidences of postoperative complications and revisions were recorded.

Results: The glenoid Aug rTSA cohort had greater improvements in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and range of motion when compared with the BG rTSA group at a minimum of 2-year follow-up, including Simple Shoulder Test, Constant score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, University of California Los Angeles score, Shoulder Pain and Disability Index score, shoulder function, Shoulder Arthroplasty Smart score, abduction, and external rotation (P < .05). Patient satisfaction was higher in the Aug rTSA group compared with the BG rTSA group (P = .006). The utilization of an augmented glenoid component instead of glenoid bone grafting resulted in approximately 50% less total intraoperative time (P < .001), nearly 33% less intraoperative blood loss volume (P < .001), approximately 3-fold less scapular notching (P < .01), and approximately 15-fold less adverse events requiring revision (P < .01) when compared with the BG rTSA cohort. Aside from SCB for abduction, the Aug rTSA cohort achieved higher rates of exceeding MCID and SCB for every PROM compared with BG rTSA. More specifically, 77.6% and 70.2% of the Aug rTSA achieved SCB for American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index vs. 55% and 48.6% in the BG rTSA, respectively (P = .003 and P = .013).

Conclusion: The present midterm clinical and radiographic study demonstrates that the utilization of an augmented baseplate for insufficient glenoid bone stock is superior as judged by multiple PROMs and range of motion metrics when compared with bone graft augmentation at minimum 2-year follow-up. In addition, when analyzed according to MCID and SCB thresholds, the use of augmented baseplates outperforms the use of glenoid bone grafting. Complication and revision rates also favor the use of augmented glenoid baseplates over glenoid bone grafting. Long-term clinical and radiographic follow-up is necessary to confirm that these promising midterm results are durable.

Abstract
Introduction: This study's purpose is to compare clinical and radiographic outcomes of primary anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA) and primary reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and an intact rotator cuff with no previous history of shoulder surgery using a single platform TSA system at a minimum follow-up of 2 years.

Methods: A total of 370 aTSA patients and 370 rTSA patients matched for age, sex, and length of follow-up from an international multi-institutional Western Institutional Review Board approved registry with a minimum 2-year follow-up were reviewed for this study. All patients had a diagnosis of OA, an intact rotator cuff, and no previous shoulder surgery. All patients were evaluated and scored preoperatively and at latest follow-up using six outcome scoring metrics and four active range of motion measurements.

Results: Mean follow-up was 41 months, and the mean age was 73 years. Preoperatively, the rTSA patients had lower outcome metrics and less motion. Postoperatively, aTSA and rTSA patients had similar clinical outcomes, motion, and function, with the only exception being greater external rotation in aTSA exceeding the minimal clinically important difference. Pain relief was excellent, and patient satisfaction was high in both groups. Humeral radiolucent lines were similar in both groups (8%). Complications were significantly higher with aTSA (aTSA = 4.9%; rTSA = 2.2%; P = 0.045), but revisions were similar (aTSA = 3.2%; rTSA = 1.4%; P = 0.086).

Conclusion: At a mean of 41 month follow-up, primary aTSA and rTSA patients with OA and an intact rotator cuff with no previous history of shoulder surgery had similar clinical and radiographic outcomes. Greater external rotation was noted in aTSA patients at follow-up. However, aTSA patients had a significantly greater rate of complications compared with rTSA patients. rTSA is a viable treatment option in patients with an intact rotator cuff and no previous shoulder surgery, offering similar clinical outcomes with a lower complication rate.

Abstract
Background: Accurate placement of the glenoid baseplate is an important technical goal of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). The use of computer navigated instrumentation has been shown to improve the accuracy and precision of intraoperative execution of preoperative planning. The purpose of this study was to compare early clinical outcomes of patients undergoing navigated RSA vs. a non-navigated matched cohort.

Methods: A retrospective review of a prospectively collected shoulder arthroplasty database was used to identify 113 patients from a single institution who underwent navigated primary RSA with a minimum 2-year follow-up. A matched cohort of 113 non-navigated RSAs was created based on sex, age, follow-up, and preoperative diagnosis. Preoperative and postoperative range of motion, functional outcome scores, and complications were reported.

Results: A total of 226 shoulders with a mean age of 71 years were evaluated after navigated (113) or non-navigated (113) RSAs. The mean follow-up was 32.8 months (range: 21-54 months). At the final postoperative follow-up, the navigated group had better active forward elevation (135° vs. 129°, P = .023), active external rotation (39° vs. 32°, P = .003), and Constant scores (71.1 vs. 65.5, P = .003). However, when comparing improvements from the preoperative state, there was no statistically significant difference in range of motion or functional outcome scores between the groups. Complications occurred in 1.8% (2) of patients undergoing navigated RSA compared with 5.3% (6) in the non-navigated group (P = .28). Scapular notching (3.1% vs. 8.0%, P = .21) and revision surgery (0.9% vs. 3.5%, P = .37) were more common in non-navigated shoulders.

Conclusion: At early follow-up, navigated and non-navigated RSAs yielded similar rates of improvement in range of motion and functional outcome scores. Notching and reoperation was more common in non-navigated shoulders, but did not reach statistical significance. Longer follow-up and larger cohort size are needed to determine if intraoperative navigation lengthens the durability of RSA results and reduces the incidence of postoperative complications.

Abstract
Introduction: Glenoid baseplate augments have recently been introduced as a way of managing glenoid monoplanar or biplanar abnormalities in reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the difference in clinical outcomes, complications, and revision rates between augmented and standard baseplates in RSA for rotator cuff arthropathy patients with glenoid deformity.

Methods: A multicenter retrospective analysis of 171 patients with glenoid bone loss who underwent RSA with and without augmented baseplates was performed. Preoperative inclusion criteria included minimum follow-up of 2 years and preoperative retroversion of 15°-30° and/or a beta angle 70°-80°. Version and beta angle were measured on computed tomographic scans, when available, and plain radiographs. Shoulder range of motion (ROM) and patient-reported outcomes were obtained from preoperative and multiple postoperative time points.

Results: The study consisted of 84 standard baseplate patients and 87 augmented baseplate patients. The augment cohort had greater mean preoperative glenoid retroversion (17° vs. 9°, P < .001). At >5-year follow-up, the increase in postoperative active abduction (52° vs. 31°, P = .023), forward flexion (58° vs. 35°, P = .020), and internal rotation score (2.8° vs. 1.1°, P = .001) was significantly greater in the augment cohort. Additionally, >5-year follow-up American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form score (87.0 ± 16.6 vs. 75.9 ± 22.4, P = .022), Constant score (78.0 ± 9.7 vs. 64.6 ± 15.1, P < .001), and Shoulder Arthroplasty Smart score (81.2 ± 6.5 vs. 71.2 ± 13.6, P = .003) were significantly higher in the augment cohort. Revision rate was low overall, with no difference between the augment and no augment groups (0.7% vs. 3.0%, P = .151).

Conclusion: In comparing augments to standard nonaugment baseplates in the setting of RSA with glenoid deformity, our results demonstrate greater postoperative improvements in multiple planes of active ROM in the augment cohort. Additionally, the augment cohort demonstrated greater postoperative level and improvement in scores for multiple clinical outcome metrics up to >5 years of follow-up with no difference in complication or revision rates, supporting the use of augmented glenoid baseplates in RSA with glenoid deformity.

Abstract
Background: As the number of anatomic and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) procedures increase, there will be a natural increase in patients who undergo staged bilateral TSA procedures. Bilateral TSAs have been shown to improve patient outcomes; however, it is unknown whether these patients experience side-to-side differences in clinical outcomes and satisfaction between shoulders. Understanding these differences is imperative for accurate patient and provider expectations.

Methods: An international multicenter registry was used to identify patients who underwent staged bilateral TSAs from April 2007 to October 2019 with a minimum of 2-year follow-up. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES) outcomes and satisfaction ratings were compared between dominant and nondominant shoulders, and first and second arthroplasties. Side-to-side differences in postoperative ASES and unequal satisfaction ratings were also explored by using regression analyses to identify potential factors influencing these differences.

Results: A total of 60 patients (22 bilateral anatomic TSAs, 38 bilateral reverse TSAs) were identified for inclusion. Group analyses revealed that bilateral TSA patients demonstrated similar functional outcomes and satisfaction regardless of dominance and surgery sequence. Type of TSA, specifically bilateral reverse TSAs, significantly predicted greater side-to-side differences in postoperative ASES scores (P = .025), indicating reverse TSA patients demonstrated greater between-sides differences in postoperative functional outcomes compared with those undergoing anatomic TSAs. Additionally, a larger proportion of bilateral reverse TSA patients reported unequal satisfaction between shoulders (31.6%) compared with anatomic TSA patients (9.1%). Logistic regression analysis revealed that greater side-to-side differences in postoperative ASES scores were found to increase the likelihood of reporting unequal satisfaction between shoulders (odds ratio 1.11, P < .001), which may explain this outcome.

Conclusions: Most patients who undergo bilateral TSAs can expect similar outcomes on both shoulders regardless of dominance and surgery sequence. However, we did find patients who had discordant results between shoulders. Those who underwent reverse TSAs more frequently reported unequal satisfaction with their TSA procedures, which is likely due to larger side-to-side differences in postoperative function. It is unclear why these differences occurred, but this information may be important for providers to remember when counseling these patients for accurate postoperative expectations.

Abstract
Background: Legacy shoulder outcome scores have postoperative ceiling scores effects when quantifying clinical outcomes for anatomic (aTSA) and reverse (rTSA) total shoulder arthroplasty patients. This study uses data from an international database of a single shoulder prosthesis using data from 30 different clinical sites to quantify and compare the percentage of aTSA and rTSA patients achieving postoperative ceiling scores with multiple outcome measures and defines the patient demographics, comorbidities, implant, and operative parameters associated with ceiling scores for each outcome measure.

Methods: Clinical outcomes for 1817 aTSA and 2635 rTSA patients between 2007 and 2019 were quantified with the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES), Simple Shoulder Test (SST), the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Constant, and Shoulder Arthroplasty Smart (SAS) scores. The number of aTSA and rTSA patients with ceiling scores were calculated and sorted into those that achieved ceiling scores with the SST, ASES, and UCLA measures and compared to patients without ceiling scores. A univariate and multivariate analysis then identified the patient demographics, comorbidities, and implant and operative parameters associated with ceiling scores for each outcome measure.

Results: aTSA patients achieved ceiling scores at a significantly greater rate than rTSA patients for all outcome measures, except SAS. The SST score was the most susceptible to ceiling scores (aTSA = 43.4%, rTSA = 34.1%, P < .0001), followed by the ASES (aTSA = 23.7%, rTSA = 13.3%, P < .0001) and UCLA (aTSA = 22.2%, rTSA = 10.6%, P < .0001) scores. Ceiling scores were least likely with the Constant (aTSA = 0.4%, rTSA = 0%, P = .0060) and SAS (aTSA = 0.1%, rTSA = 0%, P = .0750) scores. Male patients had a significantly higher ceiling score rate than female patients using the SST and ASES scores, and no differences in ceiling score rates were observed with the UCLA, Constant, or SAS scores. Finally, we identified numerous patient demographic, comorbidity, implant, and operative parameters associated with SST, ASES, and UCLA ceiling scores for aTSA and rTSA patients.

Discussion: Postoperative ceiling scores occur at a high rate for aTSA and rTSA patients with the SST, ASES, and UCLA scores. Those most susceptible to ceiling scores are aTSA patients treated with cage glenoids, aTSA patients of lower body mass index, rTSA patients of male gender, rTSA patients with osteoarthritis diagnosis, and rTSA patients with subscapularis repair. Clinical researchers should consider using alternative scores, such as the SAS score, to ensure a more normalized distribution of data and more accurately quantify aTSA and rTSA outcomes.

Abstract
The reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) prosthesis has been demonstrated to be a viable treatment option for a variety of end-stage degenerative conditions of the shoulder. The clinical success of this prosthesis is at least partially due to its unique biomechanical advantages. As taught by Paul Grammont, the medialized center of rotation fixed-fulcrum prosthesis increases the deltoid abductor moment arm lengths and improves deltoid efficiency relative to the native shoulder. All modern reverse shoulder prostheses utilize this medialized center of rotation (CoR) design concept; however, some differences in outcomes and complications have been observed between rTSA prostheses. Such differences in outcomes can at least partially be explained by the impact of glenoid and humeral prosthesis design parameters, surgical technique, implant positioning, patient-specific bone morphology, and usage in humeral and glenoid bone loss situations on reverse shoulder biomechanics. Ultimately, a better understanding of the reverse shoulder biomechanical principles will guide future innovations and further improve clinical outcomes.

1. Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty: Form and Function
The reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) prosthesis is geometrically different than the native glenohumeral joint, and these differences in form substantially modify how the shoulder mechanically functions. The rTSA “reverses” the native articular concavities of the glenoid and humerus such that a concave humeral prosthesis is positioned below a convex, spherical glenoid prosthesis. Positioning the humerus below a spherical glenoid provides the rTSA with several biomechanical advantages relative to the native shoulder, but also a few disadvantages.
The first biomechanical advantage of rTSA is that the spherical glenoid component, called a glenosphere, acts as a mechanical stop for the humerus, preventing humeral head superior migration during deltoid contraction. The deltoid is the largest muscle in the shoulder and consists of three heads that insert on the lateral side of humeral diaphsysis: (1) anterior deltoid (originating from the anterior acromion and clavicle); (2) middle deltoid (originating from the lateral margin of the acromion); (3) the posterior deltoid (originating from the scapular spine). Deltoid contraction primarily powers arm elevation. This mechanical stop converts the deltoid force into rotation, and in doing so, functionally restores joint stability for patients with an unstable shoulder.
The second biomechanical advantage of rTSA is that the glenosphere functions as a fixed mechanical fulcrum, converting the superiorly directed pull of the deltoid into arm elevation and rotation, thereby enabling active arm elevation in multiple planes over a wide range of motion. Reversing the articular concavities with rTSA is a functional substitute for the concavity compression stability mechanism that occurs in the native shoulder by the rotator cuff pulling the convex humeral head articular surface into the concave glenoid articular surface. This coordinated action of the rotator cuff muscles converts the superiorly directed pull of the deltoid into arm elevation and rotation [1]. The rotator cuff is composed of four muscles (supraspinatus, subscapularis, infraspinatus, and teres minor) that surround the proximal humeral head and function together as a dynamic fulcrum in the native shoulder to pull the humeral head into the center of the glenoid of the scapula during all positions of arm motion [1,2,3,4,5,6]. While some or all of the rotator cuff muscles may be functional with rTSA, concavity compression is no longer necessary for arm elevation with rTSA because of the fixed mechanical fulcrum and the work of the deltoid. However, a nonfunctioning deltoid is a contraindication of rTSA.
The third biomechanical advantage of rTSA is the increased deltoid abductor moment arm lengths due to the medial and inferior shift of the joint center of rotation (CoR) relative to the native shoulder (Figure 1). rTSA prostheses are typically associated with 5–10 mm [7,8,9,10] inferior and 20–30 mm [8,9,11,12,13,14] medial translation of the CoR relative to the native shoulder. Medially translating the CoR is biomechanically beneficial because it increases the length of the deltoid abductor moment arm from 10–30 mm [15,16,17,18,19] for the native shoulder with the arm at the side to 22–40 mm [19,20,21,22] for the rTSA construct (Figure 2). Muscles generate straight-line forces that are converted to torques in proportion to their perpendicular distance between the joint CoR and the muscle’s line of action [15,23]. This perpendicular distance is called the muscle moment arm, and the greater the muscle’s moment arm, the greater its capacity to generate the torque required for motion and to support external loads. For this reason, increasing the abductor moment arm length with rTSA improves the efficiency of the deltoid by requiring less muscle force to generate the same amount of torque.

Unfortunately, reversing the concavities with rTSA introduces a few biomechanical disadvantages relative to the native shoulder. As described in Figure 1, positioning the rTSA humeral component below the glenosphere both medially and inferiorly translates the humerus relative to the native shoulder. rTSA prostheses are typically associated with a 25–40 mm inferior [8,9] and 5–20 mm medial [8,9,24] translation of the humerus relative to the native shoulder. Medially translating the humerus is biomechanically unfavorable because it shortens the rotator cuff muscles and limits their ability to generate active internal/external rotation [8,9,24,25]. Inferiorly translating the humerus is biomechanically unfavorable because it alters the native orientation of the humeral muscle insertions relative to the CoR. Doing so changes each muscle’s moment arms and muscle lengths and modifies how each muscle influences motion relative to its native physiologic function. Specifically, inferior humeral translation elongates the deltoid beyond its native length, and the associated tension has been cited [26,27] as the reason for acromial and scapular stress fractures after rTSA, a serious rTSA-specific complication for which there is no currently accepted optimal treatment solution. Combined, inferiorly and medially translating the humerus has been demonstrated to elongate the deltoid by as much as 20% with some rTSA prosthesis designs, [9] reduce deltoid wrapping around the greater tuberosity, which has negative implications on joint stability and deltoid moment arm length [8,9], reduce range of motion, and shorten the rotator cuff muscles by as much as 40% [8,9]. Shortening of the rotator cuff may also be responsible for the modified scapulohumeral rhythm reported by Walker et al. [28] with rTSA, in which a greater proportion of scapular rotation occurs relative to the native shoulder (Figure 3).

As described in Figure 1, positioning the rTSA humeral component below the glenosphere both medially and inferiorly translates the humerus relative to the native shoulder. rTSA prostheses are typically associated with a 25–40 mm inferior [8,9] and 5–20 mm medial [8,9,24] translation of the humerus relative to the native shoulder. Medially translating the humerus is biomechanically unfavorable because it shortens the rotator cuff muscles and limits their ability to generate active internal/external rotation [8,9,24,25].

2. Grammont Reverse Shoulder
Reeves et al. [29] was the first to publish on a reverse shoulder prosthesis in 1972; however, there were several other reverse shoulder designs developed in the early 1970s and it is unclear who first invented the concept. Charles Neer reported developing the Mark 1, Mark 2, and Mark 3 reverse shoulder prostheses between 1970 and 1973, [30,31] but other early reverse shoulder designs were also implanted in the 1970s, including the Kolbel, Fenlin, Reeves-Leeds, Gerard and Lannelong, and Kessel reverse shoulders [29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36]. All of these reverse shoulder prostheses were constrained and utilized a fixed-fulcrum concept, securing a spherical glenoid to the scapula with a post so that it was laterally offset from the glenoid fossa. None of these early reverse shoulder designs were clinically successful, and as a result, all were abandoned in the US and European markets [31].
In 1985, Paul Grammont developed a new concept for a reverse shoulder prosthesis. His initial design featured a glenoid component that was two-thirds of a sphere fixed directly on the glenoid; this is in contrast to historical designs which utilized a sphere on a post. This new concept for a reverse shoulder prosthesis was revolutionary because it medialized the CoR relative to the native shoulder [12,37,38]. In 1991, Grammont developed the Delta III and refined his medialized CoR fixed-fulcrum concept by utilizing a glenosphere geometry having an equivalent articular radius and thickness (i.e., a hemisphere), which further medialized the CoR and positioned it at 0 mm (e.g., directly on the glenoid fossa). By medializing the CoR to the glenoid fossa, Grammont further increased the deltoid abductor moment arm lengths and improved deltoid efficiency [12,39]. Medializing the CoR had an additional benefit in that it also reduced the torque on the glenoid bone–implant interface, thereby reducing the risk of aseptic glenoid loosening. Other important design features utilized by the Delta III include a humeral prosthesis that was inlayed in the proximal humerus, a 155° humeral neck–shaft inclination angle, and a circular glenoid baseplate having a central peg with divergent fixation screws.
Since its release in 1991, the Delta III has been used to successfully treat numerous end-stage degenerative conditions of the shoulder for which there was no previous solution [12,39]. Because of these clinical successes, the Delta III was 510k cleared in the US market in November 2003. Since that 510k clearance, numerous rTSA prostheses have been developed to further improve rTSA performance and also mitigate the occurrence of complications. The literature has demonstrated that different rTSA prostheses are associated with (1) differences in the amount of humeral and glenoid bone removed during implantation [40], (2) differences in overall glenoid fixation and the methods to achieve fixation [41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48], (3) differences in ranges of motion, including different locations of impingement and different rates of scapular notching [49,50,51,52,53,54,55], and (4) differences in CoR and humeral positioning relative to the native shoulder, which directly influences several biomechanical parameters, including muscle moment arms [7,19,20,21,22], muscle lengths [8,9], and amount of deltoid wrapping around the greater tuberosity at various arm positions [8,9]. While these new design improvements and surgical technique enhancements have successfully reduced the occurrence of rTSA-related complications, improved clinical outcomes, increased range of motion, improved predictability of outcomes, and extended the use of reverse shoulder arthroplasty to new indications, including substantial glenoid and humeral bone loss, it must be acknowledge that every modern rTSA prosthesis shares Grammont’s medialized CoR heritage; this is his great innovation and it is what is most responsible for the clinical improvement observed with rTSA.
3. rTSA Prosthesis Design Considerations on Biomechanics
When performing a design optimization, it is important for the medical device developer to understand the unique interaction of the multiple various design parameters for a particular design problem. All design changes are associated with trade-offs, and with any design problem, there is rarely one optimal configuration for all use cases. Typically, there are numerous optimal configurations or configurations that confer benefit for some patients in some cases and for other patients in other cases. Accordingly, it is important to inform the user on how to select the optimal design for the correct use-case. For the reverse shoulder prosthesis, there are numerous design parameters to consider when performing a design optimization that selects the parameters that maximize performance while simultaneously de-selecting the parameters that predispose for higher complication risks.
An illustrating example of a reverse shoulder optimization analysis was conducted in 2006 by Roche et al. [53,54], who used computer modeling to independent quantify the contribution of humeral neck angle, glenosphere thickness, glenosphere diameter, glenosphere inferior offset, and humeral liner constraint on impingement, range of motion, and joint stability (as measured by the jump distance, the lateral joint displacement needed for the humeral component to escape the glenosphere). From this computer model, they demonstrated that the Grammont Delta III prosthesis impinges on the inferior scapular neck at 31° humeral abduction and concluded that the specific design parameters combinations utilized in the Delta III are not optimized. As it relates to glenosphere thickness, every 1 mm that the CoR is lateralized achieves ~5° more humeral adduction prior to impingement but has no impact on jump distance. Modifying glenosphere diameter without changing the position of the CoR (by correspondingly modifying thickness) did not change overall range of motion; however, increasing glenosphere diameter by 2 mm did increase jump distance by 0.5 mm. As it relates to glenosphere inferior offset, every 1 mm inferior shift in position achieves ~4° more humeral adduction prior to impingement. On the humeral side, as it relates to humeral neck angle, every 5° decrease in humeral neck angle relative to the 155° Delta III shifts by 5° the inferior and superior scapular impingement points. To clarify, decreasing the humeral neck angle did not increase jump distance or the overall range of motion; however, it did reduce the inferior impingement during adduction at the expense of less humeral abduction. Finally, decreasing humeral liner constraint by 0.0125 increases overall range of motion by 4° but also decreases jump distance by 0.5 mm. Based upon these findings, Roche et al. [53,54] recommended several design changes for the Grammont Delta III, and in doing so, encouraged numerous subtle design modifications of each parameter to minimize the tradeoff associated with each.
With Grammont’s glenosphere, the medial/lateral position of the CoR relative to the glenoid is determined by the difference between the glenosphere thickness and the glenosphere articular radius. Nearly all reverse shoulder designs developed since the Delta III utilize a glenosphere having a diameter between 32 and 46 mm and a thickness that is slightly more than its articular radius so that they position the CoR slightly lateral to the glenoid fossa. One unique exception is the Equinoxe inset CoR glenosphere, which is a 46 mm glenosphere that has a thickness of 21 mm, so that it positions the CoR 2 mm into to the glenoid fossa (Figure 4). By further medializing the CoR into the glenoid relative to the Delta III, this unique inset CoR glenosphere can increase deltoid efficiency by up to 10.5% relative to the Delta III and increase deltoid efficiency by >40% relative to the most lateralized CoR design available on the market [19]. However, the primary reason nearly every rTSA device developed since the Delta III utilizes a glenosphere thicker than a hemisphere is because a thicker glenosphere greatly limits humeral liner impingement with the scapula neck and reduces the occurrence of scapular notching [49,50,51,52,53,54,55]. Scapular notching is a unique complication introduced by Grammont’s medialized CoR concept. It has been demonstrated to be progressive and extend beyond the inferior baseplate screw [56,57,58], as described in the Grade 4 Nerot-Sirveaux58 classification (suggesting that an osteolytic response can also occur in response to the polyethylene wear debris). Scapular notching has been reported to occur in as many as 96% of Grammont Delta III reverse shoulders [58]. Scapular notching has been demonstrated to compromise glenoid baseplate fixation [45] and is also associated with poorer clinical outcomes, less range of motion, and less strength [59,60,61].

Figure 4. Increase in deltoid abductor moment arm length by medializing the CoR: inset CoR glenosphere (left), standard offset glenosphere (middle), and expanded glenosphere (right).
Lateralizing the CoR reduces humeral liner impingement with the scapular neck [49,50,51,52,53,54,55]. However, lateralizing the CoR also increases the torque on the glenoid bone–implant interface [45,46,48] and decreases the length of the deltoid abductor moment arms [7,19,20,52,62,63] (Figure 4). As the deltoid abductor moment arms are decreased, the deltoid becomes less effective as an abductor and requires a greater force to elevate the arm. Additionally, these elevated muscle loads increase scapular bone stresses, thereby increasing the risk of acromial and scapular insufficiency fractures, which occur at a higher rate in rTSA prostheses that lateralize the CoR relative to other rTSA design styles, as demonstrated by a recent literature meta-analysis by King et al. [64].
Modifying Grammont’s inlay humeral prosthesis to increase lateralization through the humerus has been proposed as an alternative method to maintain Grammont’s deltoid abductor moment arm lengths while also lateralizing the CoR to reduce the occurrence of humeral liner–scapular neck impingement [53,54,65]. Humeral lateralization can be accomplished by decreasing the humeral neck angle relative to Grammont 155°, decreasing the humeral liner constraint, and/or increasing the offset of the humeral liner–humeral stem connection. However, the most effective method to achieve joint lateralization without lateralizing the CoR is through the use of an onlay humeral prostheses. By placing the humeral tray/liner on top of the anatomic neck osteotomy, the humerus is shifted both laterally and inferiorly relative to Grammont Delta III, though it is important to note that the humerus is still more medial relative to the native joint and therefore it still shortens the rotator cuff relative to its native length. However, this relatively more lateral humeral positioning better tensions the residual rotator cuff muscle, offering potential for improved active internal/external rotation. More medialized rTSA prostheses are associated with greater rotator cuff muscle shortening, which limits their ability to generate active internal/external rotation and impairs a patient’s ability to conduct several activities of daily living. This more lateral positioning with an onlay humeral rTSA prosthesis lengthens the deltoid moment arm to improve joint efficiency and also better restores deltoid wrapping around the greater tuberosity. Greater deltoid wrapping offers the potential for improved joint stability [66,67,68,69]. More medialized reverse shoulder prostheses are associated with less deltoid wrapping, which reduces the horizontal stabilizing compressive force vector of the deltoid and may increase the risk of dislocation, particularly in cases of substantial medial glenoid wear [70] (Figure 5). When the native joint line is medialized with substantial glenoid erosion, the humerus is medialized and the deltoid no longer wraps around the greater tuberosity, eliminating the compressive deltoid force vector, and with sufficient humeral medialization, the deltoid may even impose a distraction vector resulting in instability. Finally, as an additional benefit, the onlay humeral component can also function as a platform humeral stem, sharing the same connection as the humeral head when used for anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA), which has numerous clinical advantages and inherent efficiencies, and most importantly, as reported by Crosby et al. [71], does not require removal of a well-fixed humeral stem when revising a failed aTSA to an rTSA.

Wrapping of the middle deltoid around the lateral proximal humerus generates a stabilizing compressive force; where a greater amount of deltoid wrapping results in a larger compression vector that imparts greater joint stability: native shoulder (left), medial glenoid/medial humerus design (middle), and medial glenoid/lateral humerus design (right).
rTSA design classification systems have been proposed to objectively categorize glenoid designs based on how they position the CoR and humeral designs based on how they position the humerus, and then combine each together to account for the combined offset and interaction. In 2013, Roche et al. [65] and Hamilton et al. [20] first introduced an rTSA design classification system, which was later refined by Routman et al. [9] This design classification system categorized glenoid prostheses with a CoR of 5 mm or less from the glenoid face as medialized glenoid (MG), and glenoid prostheses with a CoR greater than 5 mm from the glenoid face as lateralized glenoid (LG) (Figure 6). Additionally, this rTSA design classification system categorized a humeral component by humeral offset. Humeral offset is defined as the horizontal distance between the intramedullary canal/humeral stem axis to the center of the humeral liner and determines the amount of humeral lateralization. Humeral offset/humeral lateralization is influenced by humeral neck angle, humeral osteotomy, and use of an inset or onset humeral tray/stem design, where an onset humeral design includes a modular humeral tray that sits on top of the resection and may or may not be offset. Humeral prostheses with an offset of 15 mm or less are medialized humerus (MH), and humeral prostheses with an offset greater than 15 mm are lateralized humerus (LH) (Figure 7). By combining the glenoid and humeral prosthesis categorizations (MG/MH, LG/MH, MG/LH, and LG/LH) (Figure 8), an overall rTSA design classification is defined that describes the reverse shoulder prosthesis position of the CoR and also humeral offset; these two parameters both independently and combined influence biomechanics.

Figure 8. rTSA prosthesis design classification.
The MG/MH reverse shoulder prosthesis is the Grammont Delta III prosthesis and is associated with the most medial positioning of the CoR and the humerus. Because of this amount of medialization, concomitant repair of the subscapularis is recommended with this device to maintain stability [72,73]. Furthermore, because of this medialization, the use of MG/MH prostheses with an uncorrected glenoid deformity is discouraged. In such cases, bone graft or an augmented baseplate may be required to lateralize the joint line and achieve stability. Relative to the MG/MH design, an LG/MH design can utilize its more lateral glenoid position to lateralize the joint line and better tension the residual rotator cuff and also improve deltoid wrapping. By lateralizing the humerus through the glenoid, it is inherently more stable than the MG/MH prosthesis, and because of this, an LG/MH rTSA design may not require concomitant repair of the subscapularis to achieve stability [74]. However, it should be noted that the resulting deltoid abductor moment arm of the LG/MH design is less than that of MG/LH designs due to its more lateralized CoR. In contrast, an MG/LH rTSA design can utilize its more lateral humeral position to compensate for the relative joint medialization caused by the MG while maintaining a medialized CoR, thereby better tensioning the residual rotator cuff, better restoring deltoid wrapping, and further increasing the deltoid abductor moment arms. Friedman et al. reported that concomitant repair of the subscapularis is not necessary for stability with an MG/LH rTSA design [75]. A fourth rTSA design classification is the LG/LH prosthesis. Theoretically, this design style can achieve the same or better residual rotator cuff tensioning and deltoid wrapping as an LG or LH device can; however, it will have shorter deltoid abductor moment arms relative to MG/LH designs because of its lateralized CoR. It should be noted that there are not currently any LG/LH prostheses commercially available; however, when an MG/LH design is used in combination with a BIO-RSA technique (i.e., bone grafting a noneroded glenoid to achieve lateralization) [76], it effectively functions as an LG/LH design. Care should be made to not over-tension the shoulder when performing a BIO-RSA with an MG/LH prosthesis. Similarly, using a BIO-RSA technique on an MG/MH design converts that rTSA design style to an LG/MH.
As further evidence of biomechanical differences between these different rTSA prosthesis designs, MG/MH rTSA, LG/MH rTSA, and MG/LH rTSA, Liou et al. utilized a computer muscle model to quantify the muscle forces and joint reaction forces associated with these devices and compared those biomechanical characteristics to the native shoulder [63]. Liou et al. reported that all three rTSA prostheses demonstrated larger deltoid abductor moment arms, a decreased joint reaction force, and a decreased deltoid force during arm elevation relative to the native shoulder. Liou et al. also reported that the MG/LH rTSA prosthesis was associated with the lowest joint reaction force and lowest middle deltoid forces during both abduction and forward flexion as compared to the MG/MH and LG/MH rTSA designs. Similar findings demonstrating improved deltoid muscle efficiency with humeral lateralization were reported by both Giles et al. and Henninger et al. [7,62].
Within a given rTSA design classification, it is important to note that not all rTSA devices of the same design style achieve the same clinical results. For example, Routman et al. reported that 61 of 4125 patients had an acromial or scapular fracture with an MG/LH reverse shoulder prosthesis (Equinoxe; Exactech, Inc.; Gainesville, USA), for an overall fracture rate of 1.5% [77]. In contrast, Ascione et al. [78] reported that 21 of 485 patients had a scapular fracture with a different MG/LH reverse shoulder prosthesis (Ascend Flex; Stryker, Inc.; Kalamazoo, USA), for an overall fracture rate of 4.3%, and Haidamous et al. [79] reported that 10 of 84 Ascend Flex patients had a scapular fracture, for an overall fracture rate of 11.9%. While both the Ascend Flex and Equinoxe rTSA prostheses can be classified as MG/LH designs, each of these designs are associated with different amounts of humeral lateralization and distalization. As described in Figure 9 and as reported by Routman et al. [9], the Ascend Flex is associated with 5 mm greater humeral distalization and 3 mm less lateralization than that of the Equinoxe. Routman et al. [9] used a computer muscle model to compare these two MG/LH rTSA designs and demonstrated that the Ascend is associated with greater deltoid elongation, greater rotator cuff shortening, and less deltoid wrapping compared to the Equinoxe. Combined, these clinical and computer modeling results suggest that stretching the deltoid in the lateral direction is associated with a lower risk of scapular fractures than is distally stretching the deltoid when using an MG/LH design. Another important consideration when comparing these devices is that Ascione et al. [78] reported the BIO-RSA technique was used in the majority of scapular fracture cases (12 of 21) in order to achieve “glenoid lateralization”; such use of the BIO-RSA technique effectively converts the Ascend rTSA into an LG/LH design. Based upon these results, LG/LH humeral designs may be at the greatest risk for scapular fractures.

This rTSA design classification system has recently been further refined by Werthel et al. [80] by adding one new humeral offset category: minimally lateralized humerus. Using this new offset category, Werthel et al. grouped these implants into five different combined configurations by a measurement of global offset: medialized (M) rTSA, minimally lateralized (ML) rTSA, lateralized (L) rTSA, highly lateralized (HL) rTSA, and very highly lateralized (VHL) rTSA. As a validation of this modified rTSA classification system, Werthel et al. quantified the offset of 24 different rTSA prostheses and sorted each into global offset configurations as follows: five M rTSA, five ML rTSA, seven L rTSA, six HL rTSA, and one VHL rTSA, thereby demonstrating that a wide distribution of rTSA prostheses designs are commercially available [80].
4. rTSA Implant Positioning Considerations on Biomechanics
Irrespective of the specific rTSA design classification, rTSA biomechanics can also be influenced by modifying implant positioning. Regarding the humerus, implanting the rTSA humeral prosthesis with less humeral retroversion asymmetrically tensions the rotator cuff muscles, by increasing posterior rotator cuff tension while decreasing anterior rotator cuff tension [8]. Similarly, implanting the rTSA humeral prosthesis with more retroversion increases anterior rotator cuff tension while decreasing posterior rotator cuff tension [8]. Inadequate anterior rotator cuff tensioning may result in inadequate strength for active internal rotation; whereas, inadequate posterior rotator cuff tensioning may result in inadequate strength for active external rotation. A surgeon’s decision to implant a humeral prosthesis in more or less retroversion may be helpful for some patients as a particular patient may have a preferential need for more internal or more external rotation. Regarding the glenoid, various recommendations for glenoid baseplate positioning have been recommended to avoid scapular notching. Nyffeler et al. [81] recommended inferiorly positioning baseplate with or without an inferior tilt to reduce scapular notching. However, implanting the baseplate more inferiorly on the glenoid further elongates the deltoid, and that has implications on acromial and scapular stress fractures. Boileau et al. [76] recommended use of bone graft placed behind the baseplate with nonworn glenoids (e.g., BIO-RSA) to lateralize the humerus to better tension the rotator cuff and reduce scapular notching. However, this BIO-RSA technique lateralizes the CoR, which decreases the deltoid abductor moment arm and reduces deltoid efficiency. The BIO-RSA technique also increases the torque at the bone–implant interface, which increases the risk of glenoid loosening and introduces new complications of graft resorption and graft fracture [46,76,82,83].
5. rTSA Patient-Specific Considerations on Biomechanics
rTSA biomechanics can be influenced by patient-specific anatomic and morphological parameters. Every patient has different bone morphology and different muscle size/volume; as such, each patient has different muscle moment arm lengths. Jacobson et al. [16] conducted an anatomic study of 75 shoulders to investigate the variability in joint relationships between the male and female shoulders and demonstrated that middle deltoid moment arms change with gender, with male shoulders having significantly larger deltoid moment arms than those of female shoulders. The shape of the underlying bones determines how the shoulder muscles wrap around the proximal humeral anatomy, guiding deltoid wrapping and the deltoid’s line of action at various joint positions. Deltoid wrapping changes with greater tuberosity size, acromion size, acromial overhang, humeral head size, and humeral head offset. As the middle and posterior heads of the deltoid originate on the acromion and scapular spine, acromion size can also influence deltoid moment arm lengths, the amount of deltoid wrapping around the greater tuberosity, and the deltoid’s line of action at various joint positions. Concerning this point, Jacobson et al. [16] reported that acromion size and width were significantly different between male and female scapulae. For all these reasons, each patient has differing muscular capacity to generate the torque required for motion and support external loads, and the biomechanical advantages associated with rTSA may be more beneficial for some patients than for others. Furthermore, differences in bone morphology can result in differences in impingement and range of motion; for example, Middernacht et al. [84], Paisley et al. [85], and Roche et al. [86] demonstrated that shorter scapular neck lengths and larger scapular neck angles reduce rTSA range of motion and increase the risk of scapular notching [84,85,86].
rTSA biomechanics can also be influenced by glenoid bone loss. Glenoid wear and associated bone loss medialize the joint line, which shortens the rotator cuff muscles and reduces deltoid wrapping around the greater tuberosity [70]. Norris et al. [87] demonstrated that with a sufficient amount of medial glenoid wear, the deltoid can actually generate a laterally directed distraction force that can result in joint instability. Augmented glenoid baseplates were designed to conserve glenoid bone, increase prosthesis surface contact area with cortical bone, and better restore the native joint line when performing rTSA in eroded scapular morphologies [41,44,45]. Positive clinical results have been reported with augmented baseplates in a variety of types of eroded glenoids [83,88,89,90,91]. Alternatively, bone grafting the glenoid can be used to lateralize the joint line. However, Jones et al. [83] compared the rTSA clinical outcomes between bone grafting and augmented baseplates and reported that bone graft patients had significantly higher complication rates.
Finally, rTSA biomechanics can be influenced by humeral bone loss. Edwards et al. [72] reported several cases of instability in rTSA patients with proximal humeral bone loss. With proximal humeral bone loss, the lesser tuberosity can be compromised, which prevents concomitant repair of the subscapularis, increasing the risk of instability for some rTSA designs, particularly an MG/MH prosthesis. Furthermore, with proximal humeral bone loss, the greater tuberosity can be compromised, which both shortens the deltoid abductor moment arm lengths to decrease deltoid efficiency and also reduces deltoid wrapping to increase risk of instability. Sabesan et al. [92] recently reported that loss of the greater tuberosity with rTSA negatively impacts shoulder biomechanics by shortening deltoid moment arms and requiring greater muscle forces during external rotation as compared to rTSA shoulders with a greater tuberosity. For patients with humeral bone loss, humeral lateralization can be recreated through the use of a novel rTSA humeral tray that includes a tuberosity augment to reconstruct the greater tuberosity of the proximal humerus to maintain a lateral deltoid over the range of motion and increase deltoid wrapping to improve stability (Figure 10).

6. Conclusions
The rTSA prosthesis is geometrically different than the native glenohumeral joint, and these geometric differences impart several biomechanical advantages relative to the native shoulder and also a few disadvantages. The primary biomechanical advantage of the rTSA prosthesis is its larger deltoid abductor moment arms, which improves deltoid efficiency, and this, as conceived by Grammont, is achieved by medializing the CoR relative to the native shoulder. Building on this heritage, modern rTSA prostheses have been demonstrated to be an effective treatment solution to restore stability and function for patients with a wide variety of end-stage degenerative conditions of the shoulder. However, some differences in outcomes and complications have been observed between rTSA prostheses, and these differences can be partially explained by the biomechanical impact associated with the different glenoid and humeral prosthesis design parameters, and also by the impact of surgical technique, implant positioning, patient-specific bone morphology, and usage in humeral and glenoid bone loss situations on rTSA biomechanics. Which prosthesis to select for a given patient or surgical situation is not always known and may not be obvious, and future work may utilize machine learning analytic techniques, as recently performed by Kumar et al., to elucidate previously unknown correlations related to prosthesis design, surgical technique, implant placement, and implant size/type selection to better predict clinical outcomes and optimize clinical decision-making [93,94,95,96,97]. Ultimately, a better understanding of the biomechanical principles associated with rTSA prosthesis design and also surgical technique can help orthopedic surgeons improve clinical decision-making; furthermore, this knowledge should guide future innovations and further improve rTSA clinical outcomes while also reducing complication rates.
