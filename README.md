Abstract
Background: Extensive proximal humeral bone loss in the setting of shoulder arthroplasty represents a difficult challenge for the treating surgeon. Achieving adequate fixation with standard humeral prostheses can be problematic. Allograft-prosthetic composites are a viable solution for this problem, however high rates of complications have been reported. Modular proximal humeral replacement systems are another potential solution, but there is a paucity of outcome data on these implants. This study reports the two-year minimum follow-up outcomes and complications of a single system reverse proximal humeral reconstruction prosthesis (RHRP) for patients with extensive proximal humeral bone loss.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all patients with minimum two-year follow-up who underwent implantation of a RHRP for either 1) failed shoulder arthroplasty or 2) proximal humerus fracture with severe bone loss (Pharos 2 and 3) and/or sequelae thereof. Forty-four patients met inclusion criteria (average age 68.3 ± 13.1 years). The average follow-up was 36.2 ± 12.4 months. Demographic information, operative data, and complications were recorded. Pre- and postoperative range of motion (ROM), pain, and outcome scores were assessed and compared to the MCID and SCB for primary rTSA where available.

Results: Of the 44 RHRPs evaluated, 93% (n=39) had undergone prior surgery and 70% (n=30) were performed for failed arthroplasty. ROM improved significantly in abduction by 22° (P = .006) and forward elevation by 28° (P = .003). Average pain on a daily basis and pain at worst improved significantly, by 2.0 points (P < .001) and 2.7 points (P < .001), respectively. Mean SST score improved by 3.2 (P < .001), Constant score by 10.9 (P = .030), ASES score by 29.7 (P < .001), UCLA score by 10.6 (P < .001), and SPADI score by 37.4 (P < .001). A majority of patients achieved the MCID for all outcome measures assessed (56-81%). The SCB was exceeded by half of patients for forward elevation and the Constant score (50%), and exceeded by the majority of patients for the ASES score (58%) and UCLA score (58%). The complication rate was 28%; the most common complication was dislocation requiring closed reduction. Notably, there were no occurrences of humeral loosening requiring revision surgery.

Discussion: This data demonstrates that the RHRP resulted in significant improvements in ROM, pain, and PROMs, without the risk of early humeral component loosening. RHRP represents another potential solution for shoulder arthroplasty surgeons when addressing extensive proximal humerus bone loss.

Abstract
Introduction: Early reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) designs had high failure rates, mainly from loosening of the glenoid baseplate. The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening after primary rTSA using a contemporary medialized glenoid/lateralized humeral system and identify significant risk factors associated with loosening.

Methods: 7,162 primary rTSA were treated with a single platform rTSA system between April 2007 and August 2021, from which 3,127 primary rTSA patients with a minimum 2-year follow-up were identified. Patients with aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening were compared to all other primary rTSA without loosening. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to compare these cohorts and identify the demographic, comorbidities, operative, and implants associated aseptic glenoid loosening after rTSA. Odds ratios were calculated for each significant risk factor and for multiple combinations of risk factors.

Results: Irrespective of minimum follow-up, fifty-three (31F/22M) of 7,162 primary rTSA shoulders experienced aseptic glenoid loosening, for an overall rate of 0.74%. At latest 2-year minimum follow-up, thirty of 3,127 patients experienced aseptic glenoid loosening and had significantly lower clinical scores, function, active ROM, and higher pain scores as compared to patients without loosening. Univariate analysis identified that patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA, p=0.029, OR = 2.74) and diabetes (p=0.028, OR=1.84) and multivariate analysis identified Walch glenoid types B2 (p=0.002, OR= 4.513) and B3 (p=0.002, OR=14.804), use of expanded lateralized glenospheres (p=0.025, OR=2.57) and use of augmented baseplates (p=0.001, OR=2.50) as significant risk factors for aseptic glenoid loosening after rTSA.

Conclusion: The incidence of aseptic glenoid baseplate loosening was 0.74% for this medialized glenoid/lateralized humeral rTSA system. Numerous risk factors for aseptic loosening were identified, including: RA, diabetes, Walch B2 and B3 glenoids, posterior/superior augmented baseplates, and expanded lateralized glenospheres. Finally, analysis of multiple combinations of risk factors identified patients and implant configurations with the greatest risk of aseptic glenoid loosening.

Abstract
Background: Identifying risk factors for acromial and scapular fractures improves our understanding about which variables are relevant to this fracture complication; however, this data is difficult to integrate into clinical practice because the majority of rTSA patients have 1 or more risk factors. The goal of this study is to better facilitate preoperative identification of patients at-risk for acromial and scapular fracture and quantify the impact of accumulating risk factors on the incidence of fracture.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 9,079 rTSA patients from a multi-center database of a single medialized glenoid/lateralized humerus onlay rTSA prosthesis to quantify the rate of acromial and scapular fractures. A univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors for fracture. Next, we quantified the number of patients with one or multiple significant risk factors for fracture. Finally, to facilitate preoperative identification of patients most at-risk for fracture, we stratified our dataset by multiple combinations of age, gender, and diagnosis risk factors and calculated the odds ratio for each cohort to quantify the impact of accumulating risk factors on the incidence of fracture.

Results: 138 of 9,079 patients were radiographically identified to have a fracture of the acromion or scapula for a rate of 1.52%. Patients with fractures were more likely older, female, more likely to have a RA diagnosis, CTA diagnosis, and less likely to have diabetes diagnosis. 85% of rTSA patients had at least 1 fracture risk factor. Individually, age, gender, or diagnosis failed to identify any patient cohort with an odds ratio >2.5. Use of multiple combinations of patient risk factors refined identification of at-risk patients better than any individual or 2-risk factor combination and demonstrated that the patients with the greatest fracture risk were females with RA diagnosis >70 years, >75 years, and >80 years.

Conclusion: This 9,079 rTSA multi-center study demonstrated that 1.52% of patients experienced acromial and/or scapular fractures with single medialized glenoid/lateralized humerus onlay rTSA prosthesis. Our analysis identified numerous risk factors and quantified the impact of accumulating risk factors on fracture incidence. Patients considering rTSA with these age, gender, and diagnosis risk factors should be made aware of their elevated complication risk.
